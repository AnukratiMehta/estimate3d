# Estimate 3D

An app for estimating the cost and selling price of your 3d printings.

Some slicers already give you a cost estimate, but that accounts only for used material.

If you want to sell your 3D printings, you need to make sure you are selling them for the right price, so you should also consider your energy costs, failure margin, return over investment (ROI), markup, fees, etc.

That is why this tool exists: to make those calculations more effortless for you.

## Quick start

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Credits

The design used parts of the great [Meraki UI](https://merakiui.com/) collection of TailwindCSS components.
