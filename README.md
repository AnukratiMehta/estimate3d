# Estimate 3D

An app for estimating the cost and selling price of your 3d printings.

Some slicers already give a cost estimate for you, but that accounts only for used material.

If you want to sell your 3d printings you need to make sure you are selling it for the right price, so you should also consider your energy costs, failure margin, return over investment (ROI), markup, fees, etc.

That is why this tool exists, to make those calculations easier for you.

## Quick start

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
